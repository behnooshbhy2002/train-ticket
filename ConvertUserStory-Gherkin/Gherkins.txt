Gherkin for the user story: Here's the equivalent Gherkin scenario:

Feature: Search Form Validation
  As a user
  I want to be notified if I enter incomplete or incorrect information in the search form
  So that I can correct it

  Scenario: Search form with incomplete information
    Given the search form is displayed
    When I submit the form with incomplete information
    Then the form should display error messages for the required fields

  Scenario: Search form with incorrect information
    Given the search form is displayed
    When I submit the form with incorrect information
    Then the form should display error messages for the incorrect fields

  Scenario: Search form with valid information
    Given the search form is displayed
    When I submit the form with valid information
    Then the form should not display any error messages

Note that I've broken down the user story into three separate scenarios, each covering a different aspect of the search form validation:

*   The first scenario tests the behavior when the user submits the form with incomplete information.
*   The second scenario tests the behavior when the user submits the form with incorrect information.
*   The third scenario tests the behavior when the user submits the form with valid information.

Each scenario uses the Given, When, and Then keywords to describe the preconditions, actions, and expected outcomes of the test.

Gherkin for the user story: Here's the Gherkin scenario for the given user story:

Feature: User Login
  As a user
  I want to log in to my account
  So that I can access my profile and booking history

  Scenario: Successful Login
    Given the user has a valid account
    When the user enters their valid username and password
    Then the user should be logged in successfully
    And the user's profile and booking history should be accessible

  Scenario: Invalid Username
    Given the user enters an invalid username
    When the user enters their valid password
    Then an error message should be displayed indicating an invalid username

  Scenario: Invalid Password
    Given the user enters a valid username
    When the user enters their invalid password
    Then an error message should be displayed indicating an invalid password

  Scenario: Empty Credentials
    Given the user leaves the username and password fields empty
    When the user submits the login form
    Then an error message should be displayed indicating that both fields are required

Gherkin for the user story: Here's the Gherkin scenario for the given user story:

Feature: Cancel a booking
  As a user
  I want to cancel a booking
  So that I can free up the reserved seats

  Scenario: Cancel a booking successfully
    Given I have a confirmed booking
    When I cancel the booking
    Then the booking should be cancelled
    And the reserved seats should be freed up

  Scenario: Cancel a booking with an active ticket
    Given I have a confirmed booking with an active ticket
    When I cancel the booking
    Then an error message should be displayed indicating that the ticket cannot be cancelled

  Scenario: Cancel a booking with a non-existent booking ID
    Given I do not have a booking
    When I try to cancel the booking with a non-existent booking ID
    Then an error message should be displayed indicating that the booking does not exist

This Gherkin scenario captures the possible scenarios for cancelling a booking, including successful cancellation, cancellation with an active ticket, and cancellation with a non-existent booking ID. Each scenario outlines the preconditions, actions, and expected outcomes.

Gherkin for the user story: Here's the Gherkin scenario for the given user story:
Feature: View Train Details
  As a user
  I want to view train details such as departure time, arrival time, and class type
  So that I can make an informed decision

  Scenario: View Basic Train Details
    Given I am logged in as a user
    When I select a train
    Then the train details page should display the following information:
      | Field        | Value      |
      | Departure Time |            |
      | Arrival Time  |            |
      | Class Type    |            |

  Scenario: View Detailed Train Details
    Given I am logged in as a user
    And I select a train
    When I click on the "View Details" button
    Then the train details page should display the following information:
      | Field        | Value      |
      | Departure Time |            |
      | Arrival Time  |            |
      | Class Type    |            |
      | Departure Station |            |
      | Arrival Station  |            |
      | Total Travel Time |            |

  Scenario: Train Details Page Should Not Display Empty Information
    Given I am logged in as a user
    And I select a train
    When I view the train details page
    Then the page should not display empty information for any field

Please note that this is a basic implementation and might need to be adjusted based on the actual requirements and the application's behavior.

Gherkin for the user story: Here's the Gherkin scenario for the given user story:

Feature: Verify Ticket
  As a user
  I want to verify my ticket after I have obtained it
  So that I can confirm its validity and ensure it is ready for use

  Scenario: Verify Valid Ticket
    Given I have obtained a valid ticket
    When I try to verify the ticket
    Then the ticket verification is successful

  Scenario: Verify Invalid Ticket
    Given I have obtained an invalid ticket
    When I try to verify the ticket
    Then the ticket verification fails with an error message

  Scenario: Verify Ticket with Expired Date
    Given I have obtained a ticket with an expired date
    When I try to verify the ticket
    Then the ticket verification fails with an error message indicating the ticket has expired

  Scenario: Verify Ticket with Missing or Incorrect Details
    Given I have obtained a ticket with missing or incorrect details
    When I try to verify the ticket
    Then the ticket verification fails with an error message indicating the ticket details are incomplete or incorrect

This Gherkin scenario covers different scenarios for verifying a ticket, including successful verification, failed verification with an error message, and verification with specific error conditions (expired date and missing/incorrect details).
